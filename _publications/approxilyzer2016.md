Approxilyzer is an open-source framework for instruction level approximation and resiliency.
Approxilyzer provides a systematic way to identify instructions that exhibit first-order 
approximation potential. It can also identify silent data corruption (SDC) causing 
instructions in the presence of single-bit errors. Approxilyzer employs static and 
dynamic analysis, in addition to heuristics, to reduce the run-time of finding 
Approximate instructions and SDC-causing instructions by 3-6x orders of magnitude.
