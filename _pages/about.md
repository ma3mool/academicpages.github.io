I am a sixth year graduate student in computer science at [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu/), advised by [Dr. Sarita Adve](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/~sadve/) in the [RSim Research Group](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/). 

My research is broadly focused on using software-driven techniques to make hardware more reliable. Specifically, I have explored approximate computing and software testing methodologies to improve resiliency analysis; I developed a software-based technique for GPU instruction replication; and I am currently interested in the reliability characteristics of neural networks for domain-specific resiliency.
