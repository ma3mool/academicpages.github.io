I am a postdoc researcher in computer science at 
[Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science), working 
with Dr. David Brooks and Dr. Gu-Yeon Wei in the [Harvard Architecture, Circuits, and 
Compilers Group](https://vlsiarch.eecs.harvard.edu/). My research interests 
are broadly in the areas of computer architecture, machine learning, reliability,
and approximate computing. My work
focuses on addressing the role hardware errors play on an application's error
tolerance, by designed tools and techniques to help understand how
hardware errors propagate and affect software.

I completed my PhD at UIUC
under the guidance of [Dr. Sarita Adve](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/~sadve/) in 
the [RSim Research Group](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/). During my graduate studies, 
I was very fortunate to be the recipient of the 
[Mavis Future Faculty Fellowship](https://publish.illinois.edu/engr-mavis/), to be invited
to the [7th Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/), 
and to recieve multiple awards for teaching and
mentoring undergraduate students. Prior to joining UIUC, I completed my BSE from
[Princeton University](https://ece.princeton.edu/), where I was the recipient of the 
John Ogden Bigelow Jr. Prize in Electrical Engineering.

If you are a student or researcher (or both!), please feel free to reach out to me by email!
