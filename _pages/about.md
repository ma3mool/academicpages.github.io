I am a graduate student in computer science at UIUC, advised by Professor Sarita Adve (link) in the RSim Research Group (link). My primary research interests are in computer architecture, reliability, approximate computing, and heterogeneous computing. I am also broadly interested in operating systems, compilers, security, software testing, and neuromorphic processing.

Research Statement
======
As hardware technology scales, efficient resiliency solutions are needed to address the increased likelihood of hardware errors. My research interests are in protecting against hardware errors using software techniques. I have explored reducing resiliency overheads by leveraging software testing techniques, finding approximation oppurtunities
to reduce resiliency needs, and I have studied techniques for reducing instruction duplication in software. I am interested in studying cross-architectural resiliency, and extending prior work in the CPU domain to GPUs and accelerators of the future.
