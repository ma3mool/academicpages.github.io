I am a graduate student in computer science at [UIUC](https://cs.illinois.edu/), advised by [Dr.Sarita Adve](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/~sadve/) in the [RSim Research Group](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/). 


Research Interests 
======
My primary research interests are in computer architecture, reliability, approximate computing, and heterogeneous computing. 

Research Statement
======
As hardware technology scales, efficient resiliency solutions are needed to address the increased likelihood of hardware errors. My research focuses on protecting against hardware errors using software techniques. I have explored reducing resiliency overheads by leveraging software testing techniques, finding approximation oppurtunities
to reduce resiliency needs, and techniques for reducing instruction duplication in software. My current research is focused on DNN reliability and adapting software testing techniques to improve resiliency analysis.
